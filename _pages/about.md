Hello :)

On this site, I will showcase various projects, whether they are from work, school, or personal interests (typically Japanese). The focus will primarily be on projects related to programming and data science, utilizing tools and languages such as R, SAS, Python, etc.

This website is created by a fork from the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme.
